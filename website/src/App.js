      <h1>[1] Swallows Return and Wild Geese Fly North</h1>
      <h1>Day 1/7 Ends 4/11</h1>
      <p>Epoch 1 is characterized by the beginning of the Spring semester at UCSC. 
        With a 15 unit courseload of all Upper Division Courses: Data Structures 
        and Algorithms CSE101, Intro to Compilers CSE110A, and Computer Architecture
        CSE120, Epoch 1 represents the beginning of a very difficult Spring Semester 
        and a few key decisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Beginning to digitalize my journals</li>
        <li>Dropping ASTR3: Planetary Systems, a fun course, for CSE110A, a necessary 
          course</li>
        <li>The decision to have a difficult courseload</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The underlying assumptions of the key decisions is that we've already got 
        experience with CSE101 and CSE120, as well as the structure of the classes: 
        Two are mostly projects based. But the most important is the professors: 
        Tyler Sorensen (CSE110A), Patrick Tantalo (CSE101), and Sagnik Nath (CSE120)
        have the highest rate my professor scores, and people have generally loved 
        taking these professors.</p>

      <p>Personal Growth is measured by the efforts placed in your chosen field given the epoch.</p>
      <h3>Key Results:</h3>
